# Email Collection for Phone-Only Guests - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a feature that prompts guests who were added with only a phone number to provide their email address when submitting an RSVP. The email is then saved to the guest table for future communications.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Email Collection Dialog Component
**File:** `components/rsvp/email-collection-dialog.jsx`

A modal dialog that:
- Prompts users for their email address
- Validates email format using regex
- Provides clear instructions and help text
- Has cancel and submit actions
- Shows validation errors inline

### 2. Enhanced RSVP Form
**File:** `components/rsvp/rsvp-form.jsx`

Modified to:
- Detect when a guest doesn't have an email (only phone number)
- Show email collection dialog before RSVP submission
- Include collected email in the API request
- Update form state with the saved email
- Improve email field display for phone-only guests
- Pass `guestId` to API for proper guest identification

### 3. Updated API Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/attendee/guests/route.js`

Enhanced the PUT endpoint to:
- Support guest lookup by `guestId` (in addition to email lookup)
- Accept email in request body
- Update guest record with provided email (if guest doesn't have one)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing email-based lookup

### 4. Documentation
**File:** `docs/EMAIL_COLLECTION_FOR_PHONE_ONLY_GUESTS.md`

Complete documentation including:
- Feature overview and benefits
- Implementation details
- User flow for both hosts and guests
- Technical details and API changes
- Testing scenarios
- Security considerations
- Future enhancement ideas

### 5. Test Suite
**File:** `__tests__/api/email-collection.test.js`

Comprehensive tests covering:
- Guest lookup by guestId and email
- Email update functionality
- Email validation (valid/invalid formats)
- RSVP submission flow
- Request body handling
- Dialog validation logic

**All 15 tests passing âœ…**

## Key Features

### For Hosts
- No changes to workflow
- Can continue adding guests with phone number only
- Guests' email addresses are automatically collected during RSVP

### For Guests (Phone-Only)
1. Access invitation via SMS link
2. Fill out RSVP response
3. Click "Submit RSVP"
4. **Email dialog appears** (new)
5. Enter email address
6. Email validated and saved
7. RSVP submitted successfully

### For Guests (With Email)
- No changes to existing workflow
- Email field remains read-only

## Technical Highlights

### Smart Guest Lookup
```javascript
// Priority order:
if (guestId) {
  // Lookup by guestId (for phone-only guests)
} else if (email) {
  // Lookup by email (for existing guests)
}
```

### Email Update Logic
- Only updates email if:
  - Email provided in request
  - Email is valid (trimmed, not empty)
  - Guest doesn't already have an email
  
This prevents accidental overwrites.

### Validation
- Client-side email validation using regex: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
- Required field validation
- Trimming and sanitization

## Database Changes
**None required!** The existing schema already supports optional email:
```prisma
model Guest {
  email String? // Already optional
  phone String? // Already optional
}
```

## Files Changed
1. âœ… `components/rsvp/email-collection-dialog.jsx` (NEW)
2. âœ… `components/rsvp/rsvp-form.jsx` (MODIFIED)
3. âœ… `app/api/attendee/guests/route.js` (MODIFIED)
4. âœ… `docs/EMAIL_COLLECTION_FOR_PHONE_ONLY_GUESTS.md` (NEW)
5. âœ… `__tests__/api/email-collection.test.js` (NEW)

## Testing Results
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       15 passed, 15 total
```

All tests passing with:
- Guest lookup scenarios
- Email validation
- RSVP submission flow
- Dialog component behavior
- API request handling

## Next Steps for Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Create Test Event**
   - Create a new event as host
   
2. **Add Phone-Only Guest**
   - Add guest with only name + phone number
   - Note: Don't provide email
   
3. **Guest RSVP Flow**
   - Access invitation link
   - Select "Accept" response
   - Click "Submit RSVP"
   - Verify email dialog appears
   
4. **Email Collection**
   - Try submitting empty email (should show error)
   - Try submitting invalid email (should show error)
   - Submit valid email
   - Verify RSVP submitted successfully
   
5. **Verification**
   - Check guest table for updated email
   - Verify guest can view their RSVP
   - Verify email is displayed in form

### Edge Cases to Test
- Guest clicks cancel on email dialog
- Guest enters email with spaces
- Guest with existing email (should not see dialog)
- Multiple RSVP updates
- Network error during submission

## Security Considerations
âœ… Email validation prevents malformed data  
âœ… Guest lookup by guestId prevents unauthorized access  
âœ… Email updates only when guest doesn't have one  
âœ… All existing authorization checks remain in place  

## Benefits
1. **Flexibility** - Hosts can add guests with just phone numbers
2. **Data Completeness** - Emails collected when guests engage
3. **Better Communication** - Enables email notifications to all guests
4. **User Experience** - Seamless, non-intrusive popup workflow
5. **Data Integrity** - Validation ensures quality data
6. **No Breaking Changes** - Fully backward compatible

## Conclusion
The feature has been successfully implemented with:
- Clean, maintainable code
- Comprehensive testing (15 tests passing)
- Complete documentation
- No database migration required
- Backward compatibility maintained
- User-friendly interface

Ready for deployment! ðŸš€
